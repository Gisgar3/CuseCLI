# CuseCLI
 Command-line interface application that allows users to interact with Syracuse's open data.

# Purpose
**CuseCLI** was developed to provide users with an easily accessible, yet powerful application for retrieving data from Syracuse's open datasets all through the command-line. Powered with frameworks like [Clack](https://github.com/natemoo-re/clack) and [Chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk), gathering Syracuse data through a CLI has never been so simple!

# NOTICE
**CuseCLI** is in *very* early stages of development, meaning the source code isn't guaranteed to be stable. Currently (as of July 5, 2023) the application isn't complete enough to provide full retrieval of Syracuse datasets. As development continues, we will get closer to providing a fully working solution.
